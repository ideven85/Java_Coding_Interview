# Functional Programming

**Functional Paradigm**
    
- All **objects are  pure functions in the sense that they do not mutate anything**
- All variables are final, all data are immutable,
- The behavior of a method can be understood simply as a relationship between its parameters and its return value, with no side effects on any other part of the program.
