    1. CodingNinjas has given you a number. You have to print number, preceded by given number in lexicographically sorted permutation of all digits of given number.
2. If the number is last element of lexicographically sorted permutation of all digits of given number, then print the first element of the sorted list.
3. For Example: 123 -> 132 and 5243 -> 5324 and 321 -> 123
Explanation: The lexicographically sorted list of permutation of all digits of ‘123’ is:
123
132
213
231
312
321.
And the number which succeeds 123 in this list is 132 and hence, the answer. Similarly, since 321 is the last element of this list, I have to return 123, which is first element of the list.
Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains an integer.
Output Format:
The only line of output must contain number, preceded by given number in lexicographically sorted permutation of all digits of given number.
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 10^9
Sample Input 1:
123
Sample Output 1:
132
Sample Input 2 :
402356
Sample Output 2 :
402365
