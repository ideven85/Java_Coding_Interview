    /*
    Mr. P is quite upset today and he is walking in some unique way. He starts from the origin (0, 0), and in exactly 1 second, he can either move up 1 unit, move right 1 unit, or stay still. In other words, from position (x,y) , Mr. P can spend one second to move to:
->(x+1,y)
->(x,y+1)
->(x,y)
After T seconds, a villager who sees him reports that Mr. P lies on or inside a square of side-length s with coordinates (X,Y), (X+s,Y), (X,Y+s), (X+s,Y+s). Calculate how many points with integer coordinates on or inside this square could be the Mr. P's position after exactly T seconds
Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains four space-separated integers: X, Y, s, and T.
Constraints:
0 ≤ X,Y ≤ 100
1 ≤ s ≤ 100
0 ≤ T ≤ 400
Time limit : 1 sec
Output Format:
Print the number of points with integer coordinates that could be the Mr. P's position after T seconds.
Sample Input 1:
2 2 3 6
Sample Output 1:
6
